            I am currently studying Business Management, I hope to own my own business soon! This is my second semester at BYUI and I have loved it so far.

            I was raised a member of the Church, but my gradparents were converts. They had a long background of being Catholic, but were baptised together in England becasue they loved the church's doctrine about eternal families. When I was younger I was also raised in England, but now live in Colorado Springs, Colorado.
