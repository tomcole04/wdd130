      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>Alaska was made an official state of the United States of America on January 3rd, 1957 and now has a population of about 740 thousand people!</p>
      <p>Known for its beautiful auroras, diverse ecosystem, stunning glaciers, and amazing history, Alaska is one of the most breathtaking places on Earth!</p>
      <p>Whales, bears, moose, and bald eagles are a few examples of the unique animals that Alaska houses. Outdoor enthusiasts will never get bored of whale watching, dog sledding, or fishing!</p>

      <h3>Ketchikan</h3>
      <p>Ketchikan was founded on August 25th, 1900 and is populated by about 8 thousand people!</p>
      <p>Also known as "the salmon capital", fishing has never been more of a thrill than in Ketchikan! But the outdoor excitement doesn't end there. Ketchikan is settled in the heart of the Tongass National Forest, the largest national forest in the United States!</p>
      <p>Further exploration of Ketchikan tells us more about the Native Alaskan culture nestled within. This area was largely affected by the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian tribes. Totem poles showcased in areas like Saxman Totem Park, Totem Bight State Park, and Potlatch Park, and the Totem Heritage Center give us more insight into the Native life.</p>

      <h3>Juneau</h3>
      <p>Home to about 32 thousand people, Juneau was founded in 1881 and became the official capital city of Alaska in 1906!</p>
      <p>Locals and visitors often enjoy glacier trekking, where you can walk on thousand-year-old glaciers!</p>
      <p>This city was named after Joe Juneau after he discovered gold during the gold rush. Thanks to the high concentration of gold, people began to flock and it became popular quickly!</p>
